# Text-Summarization-using-ML-NLP-DL

###ABSTRACT 

In today's era of digitalization and vast amounts of online data, it has become increasingly 
important to help people efficiently extract relevant information from large volumes of text. Short 
summaries that capture the essential points are preferred over reading lengthy reports. However, 
manually summarizing lengthy articles can be a time-consuming and exhausting task. 
To address this, various attempts have been made to automate the summarization process, and 
text summarization is one such technique. 
There are two main methods of generating summaries - extractive and abstractive summarization. 
The aim of this project is to use Machine Learning, Deep Learning and NLP to automate the 
summarization process while focusing on the sections that convey useful information and 
preserve the overall meaning. 
The project involves the use of various NLP techniques such as tokenization, part-of-speech 
tagging, named entity recognition, and sentence parsing to extract relevant information from the 
text. The extracted information is then ranked based on its importance and relevance to the 
document as a whole. Finally, the system generates a summary by selecting the most important 
sentences or phrases from the document. 
The application of this project is useful in scenarios where large amounts of information need to 
be quickly and efficiently processed, such as in news articles, scientific papers, and business 
reports. The text summarization system can help users quickly extract the key information from 
a large document, saving time and improving productivity.
